The language I choosed is Python. To analyze some common steps in CI setup let's start with linting in Python. Linter is used to analyze code for potential errors and making sure the team uses same coding style over the application. in Python flake8 is commonly used to check if your code conforms to the standard Python coding style. Linting makes sure your code is easy to read for the rest of the Python community. There is also possibility to setup linter in the way your team want's and this way keep the code style solid. Second this is testing. For Pyhon there is this commonly used library pytest with whitch it's easy to run simple unittest or bigger test before pushing to the main branch (master). 

For Python there actually is CircleCI to to set up your CI. Main needed thing in CircleCI is configuration file. A configuration file contains instructions for all the steps that the build server needs to execute. CircleCI expects this file to be called config.yml. CircleCI maintains pre-built Docker images for several programming languages. In the above configuration file, you have specified a Linux image that has Python already installed. That image will create a container in which everything else happens. This means that this set-up is better self-hoster in own VM. In VM there is it's own OS. On that operating system, you deploy your application or install your library and test it.
